spEnhance Workflow
===================
spEnhance reconstructs high-resolution spatial expression from spot-level spatial transcriptomics or other types of omics techniques by leveraging H&E-stained histology images and single-cell reference information. In this tutorial, we use spatial transcriptomics as the primary illustrative example.
